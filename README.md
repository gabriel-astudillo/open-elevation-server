# Open-Elevation Server

This Open-Elevation server is based from [Open-Elevation project](https://github.com/Jorl17/open-elevation/tree/master)


**Open-Elevation Server** is a free and open-source alternative to the [Google Elevation API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/elevation/start) and similar offerings.

This service came out of the need to have a hosted, easy to use and easy to setup elevation API. While there are some alternatives out there, none of them work out of the box, and seem to point to dead datasets. This version of Open-Elevation server is [easy to setup](https://github.com/gabriel-astudillo/open-elevation-server/blob/main/docs/install.md). We offer you the whole world with our [public API](https://github.com/gabriel-astudillo/open-elevation-server/blob/main/docs/api.md).



There is also a docker version of **Open-Elevation Server**. This does not require downloading any geofiles. It is available on [docker-hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/gastudil/oes).
